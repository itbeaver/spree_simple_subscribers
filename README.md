  ```

  The `branch` option is important: it must match the version of Spree you're using.

2. Install the gem using Bundler:
  ```ruby
  bundle install
  ```

3. Copy & run migrations
  ```ruby
  bundle exec rails g spree_simple_subscribers:install
  ```

4. Restart your server

  If your server was running, restart it so that it can find the assets properly.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_simple_subscribers/factories'
```
